# msch
Mindustry Schematic Reader and Writer in Python

Currently you just do :
```

msch = Schematic.loads("string")

s = msch.saves()

```

```
# this loads the msch
msch = Schematic.loads("string")
```

```
# this saves the modifications you made 
s = msch.saves()
```

current goals:
- decent editing
- reading and writing logic processors
- cleaning up
